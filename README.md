`wifi-central-controlled-aggregation_v140.cc` is the ns3 file used for the paper.


## Content of the repository

The `.cc` file contains the ns3 script. It has been run with ns3-26 (https://www.nsnam.org/ns-3-26/).

The folder `shell_scripts_used_in_the_paper` contains the files used for obtaining each of
the figures presented in the paper.

## How to use it

- Download ns3.

- Put the `.cc` file in the `ns-3.26/scratch` directory.

- Put a `.sh` file in the `ns-3.26` directory.

- Run a `.sh` file. (You may need to adjust the name of the `.cc` file in the `.sh` script).
